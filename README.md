# Custom RSS Feed Plugin for WordPress

Description:

Creates a custom RSS feed of the latest 3 posts that can be accessed at yourdomain.com/customfeed e.g. https://stevehodgkiss.net/customfeed

The RSS feed can be used in services such as at IFTTT.com, that reads it for the source of an Applet.

Runs once when activated and then every 12 hours.

Disables all other RSS feeds.
